# Bare Minimum Rust Project To Get Started with ARM
## What is this
This repository contains the bare minimum to get started with the STM32F103XX microcontroller rust programming, which features a Cortex-M3 ARM processor.

This project relies on cargo, the rust package manager, to build the project. It was configured to cross compile the code to the ARM architecture, and contains a custom linker code.

## Motivation
Rust is a very promising programming language, and it is very well suited for embedded systems programming. This project aims to provide a simple way to get started with rust programming on ARM microcontrollers.

## Repo Branches
This repo may contain many branches as templates or branches that uses crates and so.
